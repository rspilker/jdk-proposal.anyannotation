	<title>Any Annotations Proposal for JDK8: How to experiment with this feature</title>
</head><body>
	<h1>Any Annotation Proposal for JDK8</h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
		Currently (in JDK7), you can put annotations inside annotations, but you have to specify the exact type of annotation; there is no wildcard way
		to say 'any annotation is fine'. For example, while you can do this in JDK7:
		<pre>
public @interface GeneratePersistencePojo {
	Entity[] onClass() default {@Entity};
}</pre>
		To for example power an annotation processor that generates JPA compatible pojos. However, the ability to specify which annotations should be placed
		on the generated class is here virtually useless; only annotations of the type <code>@Entity</code> are allowed. What we would like to say is something like:
		<pre>
public @interface GeneratePersistencePojo {
	java.lang.annotation.Annotation[] onClass() default {@Entity};
}</pre>
		To indicate that any annotation is fine. This is, unfortunately, not legal in JDK7.
	</p><p>
		This proposal is just that: To let the above syntax be legal in JDK8.
	</p>
	<h2>Experimenting instructions</h2>
	<p>
		You can experiment with this feature yourself without having to recompile javac, the JDK, or even find a custom binary for your platform.
	</p><p>
		Just download the <a href="anyannotation.jar">anyannotation.jar</a> agent which will 'live patch', in memory, the Oracle/OpenJDK javac compiler.
	</p>
	<h3>Live-patching javac</h3>
	<h4>Command Line</h4>
	<p>
		For example, to compile on the command line:
		<pre>
javac -J-javaagent:anyannotation.jar *.java</pre>
		Note that you need a 1.7 javac for the agent to work.
	</p><p>
		You do not need to live-patch the JVM itself because all JVM-related code actually already supports this feature, with one exception:
		A system assertion check will fail. Normally these system assertions are disabled, but if you are running <code>java</code> with the <code>-esa</code>
		option, which turns on system assertions, this new feature will fail. The live agent does not address this oversight, although a fix is listed in the
		patch record, which you can use if you can build the JVM from sources.
	</p>
	<h4>Ant</h4>
	<p>
		In ant:
		<pre>
&lt;javac fork="true" srcdir="${src}" destdir="${build}"&gt;
	&lt;compilerarg value="-J-javaagent:anyannotation.jar" /&gt;
&lt;/javac&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	<h4>Maven</h4>
	<p>
		In Maven:
		<pre>
&lt;project&gt
  [...]
    &lt;build&gt;
      [...]
        &lt;plugins&gt;
          &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt
            &lt;version&gt;2.3.2&lt;/version&gt
            &lt;configuration&gt;
              &lt;compilerArgument&gt;-J-javaagent:anyannotation.jar&lt;/compilerArgument&gt
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
          &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
      [...]
    &lt;/build&gt;
  [...]
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	<h3>Building it yourself</h4>
	<p>
		Head on over to the <a href="http://github.com/rspilker/jdk-proposal.anyannotation">github project page</a> to download the sources via git,
		then run <code>ant test</code> to build the project and run the tests.
	</p>
	<h3>The full proposal</h3>
	<p>
		The full proposal, including updates to the Java Language Specification and Java Virtual Machine Specification, as well as all patches required
		to the OpenJDK itself (javax.lang.model, java.lang.reflect, and javac itself), and some discussion on impact, use cases, and compatibility issues,
		can be found in <a href="anyannotation-full-proposal.md">markdown format</a> and <a href="anyannotation-full-proposal.html">html</a>.
